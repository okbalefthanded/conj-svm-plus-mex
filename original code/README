This implementation is an extension of libsvm and implements alternating SMO and conjugate
alternating SMO for solving SVM+, described in [1] and [2]. 

To generate executables run "make all".

As in libsvm, you can see the description of all parameters by simply running ./svm-train .
To speed up the experiments, I usually ran SVM+ with a relatively loose stopping criterion: -e 1.9 .

Feel free to ask any questions that you might have!
